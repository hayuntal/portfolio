### A/B Testing Project - Cookie Cats

This project focuses on A/B testing for the popular mobile game Cookie Cats to understand how different game designs impact player retention and engagement. The data is loaded from a PostgreSQL database, which serves as a robust platform for handling and storing extensive gameplay data. Python scripts are then utilized for further data manipulation, executing queries, and visualizing data distributions.

This integrated approach allows for a detailed analysis of game rounds and user interactions, aiming to provide actionable insights that can help optimize the game's features and improve player experience.
